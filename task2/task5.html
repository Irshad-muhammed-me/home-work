       <q> <i> I cannot prevent some people from feeling angry and frustrated and mad in response to my death</q>
        but I hope they will take the frustration and madness and instead of demonstrating or anything of 
        that type, I would hope that they would take the power and I would hope that five, ten, one hundred,
        a thousand would rise. I would like to see every gay lawyer, every gay architect come out, stand 
        up and let the world know. That would do more to end prejudice overnight than anybody could imagine.
       I urge them to do that, urge them to come out. Only that way will we start to achieve our rights.
       … All I ask is for the movement to continue, and if a bullet should enter my brain, <q>let that bullet 
       destroy every closet door…</q></i>
